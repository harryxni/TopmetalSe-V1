# Results

In this directory, I am including the results of testing that we have done with the TopmetalSe.

## Guard Ring Pulsing for Charge Sensitive Amplifiers
An example of how we characterize the in-pixel charge sensitive amplifiers. This for a single pixel in a notebook.

We demonstrate the low-noise of these pixels.

## Visible Light Imaging
Testing the ability of the TopmetalSe to actually take images.

## Alpha Event Imaging
This result shows the TopmetalSe's ability to image external charge that lands on the pixel electrodes.

## Photoelectric Effect Imaging
Measuring the pixel array's collection efficiency by generating and measuring a calibrated amount of electrons external to the pixel array.
