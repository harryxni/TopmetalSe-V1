# TopmetalSe - V1

I'll store a bunch of files here related to the internals of the chip itself. This directory should serve as a reference.
The actual design files are kept in its own repo, but they are mostly useless unless you are interested in working with the IC design software.

I'll try to add any files which I think are useful.

There are two main parts to this chip: the Caravel SOC and the actual user project which contains the pixel array.

## Caravel SOC
I'll take some time to explain the things I've learned about the Caravel SOC, as a lot of it is not obvious/easy to understand.


## Pixel Arrays
